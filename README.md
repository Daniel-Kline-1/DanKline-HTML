I compair different city's latitude to different weather metrics to see if there
is any correlation. The different metrics are wind speed, humidity, maximum temperature,
and cloudiness. The only significant correlation is with latitude and the maximum 
temperature. On the website there is an option to see each plot on it's own. To see any plot
on its own simply click on the graph. There is also an option to see every plot on one page 
to compare each plot. To see the data used for the graphsyou can click on the "Data" icon
on the top right.
